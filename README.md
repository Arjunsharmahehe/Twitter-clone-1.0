# X( twitter ) Clone 1.0

It's a clone of [X](https://arjunsharmahehe.github.io/Twitter-clone-1.0/), formerly called [Twitter](https://arjunsharmahehe.github.io/Twitter-clone-1.0/). This website was made laptop first, so it is scaled down to fit smaller screens. The interface on mobiles is fine but not optimal.   
It is marked as version 1.0 and I look forward to making a better one in the future, but I don't want to change this.

## Color Reference
I didn't use variables for the colors, feel free to add them. I will surely push them to the main branch.

| Color             | Hex                                                                |

## Lessons Learned

In the making of this project, I stumbled upon a lot of hurdles which taught a lot, like how to effectively utilize flex containers, how to make the website **responsive**, how you're not supposed to define pixels but use percentages, and how to use **media queries**.
